## Introduction

Proper clicker training isn't just about following trends—it's about understanding your cat's unique needs and biology.

## Understanding the Fundamentals

Creating a consistent routine around clicker training helps your cat feel secure and understand expectations, reducing anxiety for both of you.

Environmental factors significantly impact outcomes. Ensure your home setup supports your goals rather than working against them.
## Best Practices and Techniques

Begin by carefully assessing your current situation. Take detailed notes about your cat's behavior, preferences, and any challenges you're currently facing.
