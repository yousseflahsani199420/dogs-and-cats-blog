**Key Recommendations:**
- Consult with your veterinarian before making significant changes to routines or care

- Invest in quality tools and resources rather than making do with inadequate alternatives
- Start slowly and build gradually rather than rushing to achieve quick results
- Keep a journal to track progress and identify what works best for your specific situation
## Why This Matters for Your Pet

Documentation is your friend. Keeping records allows you to track progress, identify patterns, and make data-driven adjustments to your approach.
