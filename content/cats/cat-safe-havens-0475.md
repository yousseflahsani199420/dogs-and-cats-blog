## Introduction

Many cat owners underestimate the importance of safe havens, often leading to preventable challenges down the road.

## Understanding the Fundamentals

Begin by carefully assessing your current situation. Take detailed notes about your cat's behavior, preferences, and any challenges you're currently facing.

When approaching safe havens, it's crucial to consider your cat's individual temperament, age, and health status. What works perfectly for one pet may need significant modification for another.

Environmental factors significantly impact outcomes. Ensure your home setup supports your goals rather than working against them.
