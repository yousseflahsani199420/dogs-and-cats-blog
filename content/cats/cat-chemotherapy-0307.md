## Introduction

Proper chemotherapy isn't just about following trends—it's about understanding your cat's unique needs and biology.

## Mistakes to Avoid

When approaching chemotherapy, it's crucial to consider your cat's individual temperament, age, and health status. What works perfectly for one pet may need significant modification for another.

While budget constraints are real, remember that cutting corners on chemotherapy often results in higher costs later, whether through veterinary bills or behavioral interventions.

Research consistently demonstrates that cats receiving proper attention to chemotherapy exhibit fewer behavioral problems and enjoy stronger immune systems throughout their lives.

Documentation is your friend. Keeping records allows you to track progress, identify patterns, and make data-driven adjustments to your approach.

**Key Recommendations:**
- Prioritize safety above all else, especially when trying new techniques or products
- Keep a journal to track progress and identify what works best for your specific situation
- Celebrate small wins to maintain motivation through the inevitable challenges
- Establish a consistent schedule that both you and your cat can depend on
## When to Seek Professional Help
