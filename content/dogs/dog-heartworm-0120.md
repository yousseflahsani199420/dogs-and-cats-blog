## Why This Matters for Your Pet

Documentation is your friend. Keeping records allows you to track progress, identify patterns, and make data-driven adjustments to your approach.

The foundation of successful heartworm lies in consistency and patience. Rushing the process often leads to setbacks that could have been avoided with a methodical approach.

Creating a consistent routine around heartworm helps your dog feel secure and understand expectations, reducing anxiety for both of you.
## Mistakes to Avoid

Begin by carefully assessing your current situation. Take detailed notes about your dog's behavior, preferences, and any challenges you're currently facing.

Timing plays a critical role in success. Understanding your dog's developmental stages and natural rhythms will help you achieve better results with less frustration.

**Key Recommendations:**
- Invest in quality tools and resources rather than making do with inadequate alternatives
- Start slowly and build gradually rather than rushing to achieve quick results
- Document everything so you can reference what has worked in the past
