Timing plays a critical role in success. Understanding your dog's developmental stages and natural rhythms will help you achieve better results with less frustration.

Begin by carefully assessing your current situation. Take detailed notes about your dog's behavior, preferences, and any challenges you're currently facing.

Documentation is your friend. Keeping records allows you to track progress, identify patterns, and make data-driven adjustments to your approach.

Research consistently demonstrates that dogs receiving proper attention to stranger danger exhibit fewer behavioral problems and enjoy stronger immune systems throughout their lives.

**Key Recommendations:**
- Be prepared to adjust your approach based on your dog's feedback and progress
- Establish a consistent schedule that both you and your dog can depend on
- Document everything so you can reference what has worked in the past
- Prioritize safety above all else, especially when trying new techniques or products

While budget constraints are real, remember that cutting corners on stranger danger often results in higher costs later, whether through veterinary bills or behavioral interventions.
