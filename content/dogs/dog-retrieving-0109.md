## Introduction

Proper retrieving isn't just about following trends—it's about understanding your dog's unique needs and biology.

Research consistently demonstrates that dogs receiving proper attention to retrieving exhibit fewer behavioral problems and enjoy stronger immune systems throughout their lives.
## Troubleshooting Guide

- Celebrate small wins to maintain motivation through the inevitable challenges
- Document everything so you can reference what has worked in the past
- Establish a consistent schedule that both you and your dog can depend on
