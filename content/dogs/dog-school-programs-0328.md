## Getting Started: First Steps

When approaching school programs, it's crucial to consider your dog's individual temperament, age, and health status. What works perfectly for one pet may need significant modification for another.

While budget constraints are real, remember that cutting corners on school programs often results in higher costs later, whether through veterinary bills or behavioral interventions.

Environmental factors significantly impact outcomes. Ensure your home setup supports your goals rather than working against them.

Begin by carefully assessing your current situation. Take detailed notes about your dog's behavior, preferences, and any challenges you're currently facing.

**Key Recommendations:**
- Start slowly and build gradually rather than rushing to achieve quick results
- Establish a consistent schedule that both you and your dog can depend on
- Be prepared to adjust your approach based on your dog's feedback and progress
