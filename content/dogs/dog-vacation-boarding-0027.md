- Prioritize safety above all else, especially when trying new techniques or products
- Document everything so you can reference what has worked in the past
- Establish a consistent schedule that both you and your dog can depend on
- Invest in quality tools and resources rather than making do with inadequate alternatives

While budget constraints are real, remember that cutting corners on vacation boarding often results in higher costs later, whether through veterinary bills or behavioral interventions.
